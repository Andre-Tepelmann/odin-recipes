# odin-recipes

In the first Project from The Odin Project i will build an basic website for Recipes.

I will utilize basic html.

During this project i have build an index with the basic Boilerplate and links to 3 different recipes.
The recipe sites mostly utilize the header,paragraph,anchor,image and list features of html. 

I also added an image to every recipe page.
